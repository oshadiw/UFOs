# UFOs

## Summary of Analysis
  
  This project takes data from user submitted UFO sightings and adds it to a website where it can be filtered by Date, City, State, Country and/or Shape of the UFO sighting. This was done using JavaScript and html indexing. A function in JavaScript was created to loop through all of the filters and keep any data that matches the filter values:

   Once the user inputs the desired values they want to see, the table updates to filter and show only those values. Below is an example of filtering all of the reported UFO sightings in Canada.

## Recommendation for Further Studies

  For further exploration, a filter could be created to show what day of the week the UFO Sightings occur to see if there is any correlation.
