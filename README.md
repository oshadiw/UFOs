## Summary of Analysis
  
  This project takes data from user submitted UFO sightings and adds it to a website where it can be filtered by Date, City, State, Country and/or Shape of the UFO sighting. This was done using JavaScript and html indexing. A function in JavaScript was created to loop through all of the filters and keep any data that matches the filter values:

  Once the user inputs the desired values they want to see, the table updates to filter only those values.
